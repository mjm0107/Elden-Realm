      <h2>News and Updates</h2>
      <p class="news">
        To celebrate the first anniversary of Elden Ring, publisher Bandai Namco
        has revealed an intriguing deep dive into the antics of players and the
        surprising amount of times they've died on their quest to survive the
        Lands Between. According to this analysis, Elden Ring players have now
        officially hit a grand total of 9 billion deaths with the vast majority
        being delivered by enemies. Around 69% of these deaths were at the hands
        of enemies and NPCs, while a further 15% of deaths were caused by status
        effects. Shockingly, around 14% of deaths were caused by falling with
        clumsy players contributing to a hefty total. Given the sheer amount of
        signs littered around the Lands Between that encourage players to jump
        off cliffs to find "secrets", perhaps we shouldn't be so surprised. In
        more heartening news, just 2% of players were killed as a direct result
        of another player.
