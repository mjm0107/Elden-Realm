      <h1>About The Name and Lore</h1>

      <p>
        Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players
        freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed
        using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of
        travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items.
        Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including
        non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the
        game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to
        improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden
        Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other
        for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, a fictional realm over
        which several demigods rule. It was previously ruled over by the
        immortal Queen Marika, who acted as keeper of the Elden Ring, a powerful
        force that manifested itself as the physical concept of order. When
        Marika shattered the Elden Ring and disappeared, her demigod children
        began fighting over pieces of the Ring in an event called The
        Shattering. Each demigod has a shard of the Ring called a Great Rune,
        which corrupts them with power. In the game, the player character is a
        Tarnished, one of a group of exiles from the Lands Between who are
        summoned back after the Shattering. The player must traverse the realm
        to repair the Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord.

      <h2>Elden Ring Story and Lore Summary</h2>

      <p>
        Elden Ring has been out for a few weeks now, so it feels like a good
        time to try and figure out what the hell is going on with its story.
        FromSoftware games are very well-known for making players work hard to
        get to the core of what the story is actually about, which is why
        YouTubers like VaatiVidya are so popular, because they're more than
        happy to get stuck into the worlds and help us lot out with easy to
        understand videos. Elden Ring's story is a little more overt than many
        other FromSoftware games, but it also chucks a lot of it at you the
        moment the game begins. So, it's still not what most people would call
        easy to understand. Thankfully, as we've had a bit of time with the game
        now, we're on hand to help explain the basics of The Lands Between, what
        it is your Tarnished is meant to be doing there, and also what happens
        as you make your journey through the game.
      </p>
      <h2>Elden Ring Story-Intro and Lore</h2>
      <p>
        The world of Elden Ring is one filled with magic, miracles, and
        demi-gods. The game is set in a place called the Lands Between, where
        demi-gods rule over different regions in the wake of wars and events
        that led to the shattering of the titular Elden Ring. The Elden Ring is
        a conduit of sorts that is at the centre of the power of the Erdtree,
        which blesses the Lands Between with immortality, as a result. The world
        is kept in balance, primarily, by Queen Marika, one of the most powerful
        immortals, who went on to have a few children, who are classed as
        demi-gods. Her second husband was a man called Radagon, who was
        initially with Rennala. There are also some hints in the game that
        Marika and Radagon are literally halves of the same person, but itâ€™s
        hard to know for certain. Because of this legacy of immortals and gods,
        death is highly unusual, let alone the death of one of the great lords.
        Despite that, the world was turned on its head when a group discovers
        the key to ending immortality and descends upon the Lands Between to
        kill Godwyn the Golden, and the body of Ranni the Witch, but not her
        soul. After this event, the Elden Ring was shattered, seemingly by
        Radagon, and the world was thrown into chaos. This is because of
        multiple things. For starters, some people became unable to see the
        guiding grace of the Erdtree because of its weakened power. These beings
        are known as Tarnished (which is you) and are all seemingly linked to
        the first Elden Lord Godfrey, in some way. This also led to the other
        demi-gods ending up locked in an endless battle with one another, unable
        to overcome each other, thus throwing the Lands Between into war, and
        also leading to it being effectively segmented too.
      </p>
      <h2>Elden Ring Story-Progression</h2>
      <p>
        Because of all of this, and the residual tension that now reigns over
        the Lands Between, the Tarnished have been called back with the hope of
        creating a new Elden Lord. That's where you come in, as you are one of
        those Tarnished. Now, this is where things get tricky. You can take
        multiple paths through Elden Ring, at least up until a point, and there
        are also multiple endings. So, we're going to have to be a little bit
        vague here, because your playthrough will dictate your own story.
        However, the general gist of things is that you'll fight and kill a
        bunch of enemies including some of these legendary demi-gods, with the
        aim being to repair the broken Elden Ring. However, no matter which path
        you choose, you'll find yourself at an impasse with the Erdtree itself
        at one point, and that means you have to burn it to gain entry in order
        to actually do this. You don't actually have to kill off all of the
        demi-gods, at all. In fact, you only need to kill two optional ones and
        then progress through the story to see the ending, but it won't be a
        good one.
      </p>
      <h2>Elden Ring Story-Endings</h2>
      <p>
        There are at least six Elden Ring endings. The first four of these are
        dictated by which Mending Rune you've gone out of your way to find. If
        you've not found one, then you get to reign over a fractured age, which
        is the standard ending. However, via a few NPC side quests, you can find
        different Mending Runes to change the way the Elden Ring functions in
        some way, each of which tweaks the outcome. You can also choose to
        reject the natural order of things and embrace the Three Fingers
        instead. This leaves you branded and with bright yellow glowing eyes,
        and also leads to you becoming the Lord of the Frenzied Flame. That's
        one hell of a title, but it'll also kind of doom the Lands Between, but
        hey, they've been treating you like rubbish anyway. Finally, you can
        follow along with Ranni the Witch to unlock the Age of the Stars Ending.
        This is an ending where, rather than embracing the Elden Ring, you
        choose to overthrow Marika in order to bring the world into a new age.
        This Age of the Stars is one where everyone is guided by moonlight, and
        immortality is no more, and souls are free to move on.
