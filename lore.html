      <h2>Lore of the Elden Ring!</h2>
      <p class="lore-m">
        Malenia was born the child of Queen Marika the Eternal and her second
        husband, the Elden Lord Radagon. She had an elder twin brother by the
        name of Miquella. Both Malenia and Miquella were Empyreans, meaning they
        had the potential to one day replace their mother as a new god of a
        coming age. But since Radagon and Marika were in fact the same person,
        Malenia and Miquella were born afflicted. Malenia was afflicted with the
        Scarlet Rot, which ravaged her from within and would cost her several
        limbs, while Miquella was afflicted with eternal childhood, unable to
        ever grow into adulthood. At some point, Malenia encountered a blind
        swordsman who had sealed away an Outer God of Rot. The swordsman became
        her master, and trained her in the ways of the blade, allowing her to
        gain wings of unparalleled strength. Malenia would eventually become a
        warrior without peer. She would attract loyal servants like her Cleanrot
        Knights who vowed to fight next to her despite the inevitable gradual
        putrefaction of their flesh, as well as worshippers, who believed her a
        goddess. Members of House Marais, who were all sickly born, were
        naturally drawn to the beautiful and fierce Malenia who became such a
        powerful warrior despite being born into rot and requiring prosthesis to
        fight. Malenia and Miquella were close, and Malenia would become her
        brother's sworn blade and protector, while Miquella worked tirelessly to
        try and undo the curses, they had both been born into. While unable to
        find a cure for his sister, Miquella designed a needle of unalloyed gold
        that could keep the Scarlet Rot ravaging Malenia's body at bay.

        The storyteller folds her slender hands - both pairs - and speaks. “It
        happened an age ago. But when I recall, I see it true.” So begins the
        tale of the Shattering, a devastating war between the children of
        Marika, Demigods of the Lands Between. One grim night in the depths of
        winter, a flock of unknown assassins stole across the Lands Between. In
        a continuous attack, this foul covenant snuffed out the lives of many of
        the God-Queen's kin throughout the empire, too numerous and too
        scattered for her godly protection to save. The assassins' targets were
        multifold, but none was as devastating a loss to the Eternal Queen as
        that of Godwyn the Golden. After his death, the Elden Ring was somehow
        shattered, and the order of the world broke with it. Out of this chaos
        came war. Open, bitter war, pitting blood against blood and kin against
        kin. The conflict broke a vast and prosperous empire into brittle
        fragments. No single side could find enough purchase to maintain a
        decisive victory, even when fueled by the power of a Great Rune. The
        battle of General Radahn against Malenia the Severed illustrated that
        neither strength nor skill alone would be enough to take control of the
        entirety of the lands Marika had united. And so, the Lands Between are
        no longer gripped by open war, but caught in an uneasy stalemate that
        seems impossible to resolve. “Unless of course,” the storyteller says, a
        coy smile on both her lips, “thou shouldst take the crown?” Take a
        deeper dive into the carefully crafted mythology of George R.R. Martin
        author of The New York Times best-selling fantasy series, A Song of Ice
        and Fire and the world created by FromSoftware based on his work in this
        new trailer available here. Transported to ages long ago, you will
        relive the Shattering, a war that brought darkness to the Lands Between,
        initiated by demigods' hunger for power. You'll fight alongside General
        Radahn and Malenia the Severed, but even these two undefeatable warriors
        couldn't reunite a world so badly broken. There is only one hope left:
        the hope that a new Elden Lord will rise and lift the veil of shadows
        that has fallen over Marika's domain. The wait is almost over. Soon
        you'll venture into the Lands Between and strive to become its Elden
        Lord. Stand ready, Tarnished, and prepare to claim what fate has
        promised you.
