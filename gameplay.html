      <p>
        You can find openings by being aggressive and dodging into him. You can
        parry using blasphemous claw if you have it. You can use it during 3
        specific moves when the sword is glowing gold. The pile driver from when
        he jumps down from the pillar. His slash after 3 air spin move. Pile
        driver after 2 air spin move. My advice is to stick close and get in
        attacks while dodging. When he does his overhand swings as long as you
        are next to his body the swings will miss. When he digs his sword into
        the ground stay away from the front. Go to the side or behind him while
        avoiding the explosion. If you stay at the front he will front flip into
        destined death. If you dodge away from his swings and don't stick next
        to him, he will use his front flip attacks. Dodge towards him and not
        away. Attack after dodging, you can get maybe one or two slash and
        prepare to dodge again. Again dodge towards him and attack. If he
        backsteps high ready roll towards him once past the swing and attack. If
        he backsteps low ready, roll twice to his left or jump over his spin and
        attack.

      <h2>strategies, level reqs, and tips for Maliketh</h2>

      <p class="level">
        For me... Bloodhound Fang (maxed), Mimic tear, heavy armor, golden order
        incantations for dps increase and defense.
      </p>

      <p class="level">
        Before getting to this point, players will naturally be at a higher
        level, considering this fight is nearing the end of the game.
        Regardless, try to aim to be at least level 130, ideally 150 with maxed
        weapons. It's also important to note that Maliketh will constantly try
        to diminish any gap between himself and the player, making ranged
        weapons obsolete if you're fighting alone.
      </p>

      <p class="level">
        Don't feel bad about using summons. Anyone who says using an Ash Summon
        means you didn't beat the boss is an elitist. Mimic Tear is gonna be one
        of your best bets even after the nerfs. I've had a lot of success with
        using Scarlet Rot against him. It's a pain to find an opening, but if
        you can tag him with it, Scarlet Rot will deal about 40% of his health
        bar. And his resistances reset between phases. Use the columns to block
        his projectiles and some of his movement. His melee attacks can extend
        just past them though, so watch for that. The range he has in Beast
        Cleric form is pretty limited. Make use of that to conserve as many
        heals as you can.
